The files in this repository read .tiff images of what we call dye-leakage instances from the wells of suspended lipid bilayers. To know what suspended lipid bilayers are please read the article https://doi.org/10.3390/membranes12121190.
Put all the code files in the same folder.
Put all the time-series images in one folder.
Make sure that the image filenames carry information of the timestamp.
You start with running the script named masterscript.m. It uses all the function files plus the custom colormap.
You need globalplots.m only when you need to compare the statistics across four different variants of the same experiments.
